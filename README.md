# NTUA-Artificial-Intelligence

## Projects and Theoretical Exercises for the 2021-2022 NTUA class Artificial Intelligence

> Projects

🔴 <b>1st Project: The aim of the project is to apply algorithms for searching and finding the best path in a maze of dimensions N×N </b>

🔴 <b>2nd Project: The aim of the project is to build a Recommendation System for movies. These suggestions will be derived both from the characteristics of the film and from certain evaluations of each user. </b>

🔴 <b>3rd Project: In this project, various (relatively simple) machine learning algorithms will be implemented for the automatic recognition between 3 music genres from the data provided by the Spotify service.</b>

> Theoretical Exercises

🔴 <b>1st Exercise: Contains various problems of searching algorithms. </b>

🔴 <b>2nd Exercise: Contains various problems on logic </b>

🔴 <b>3rd Exercise: Contains various problems on machine learning, uncertainty and fuzzy </b>
